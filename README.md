#twittler
This is a project from the [Hack Reactor] (http://hackreactor.com) Curriculum that I completed as a student at [Makersquare](http://makersquare.com). This Twittler Application uses jQuery to display auto-generated user tweets, allow users to add new tweets, sort tweets by user, and provides a timestamp for all tweets.
